After download, run the bash script preinstall.sh to install Node dependecies, then run run.sh (you may need to run chmod 777 on each file first if they aren'
executable).
Run.sh will run the server in the background on the terminal on localhost:9000; to access the website, go to localhost:3000.

You can run the programs on different terminals by running node server.js in webservice and npm run build, then npm run start in webapp. They will need 
to be running on the same computer, though. 

Thanks for this opportunity! It was fun!
